              <img src="img/micah.jpg" alt="Photo of Micah" class="micah">
              <p>Micah Zaayer grew up just outside of Portland, OR on a beautiful couple of acres in the Germantown area. Coming fresh out of the Oregon cannabis industry, Micah has ample experinece operating operating in a highly repgulated and competitive market.</p>
              <p>At Bridge City Collective, Portland's first mulit-licensed cannabis retail chain, Micah lead BCC's rollout of one of Portland's first cannabis delivery services. Micah was also part of a team that recieved one of Ohio's highly-competitve, for-merit medical cannabis retail licenses in 2018.</p>
              <p>While at BCC, Micah worked closely with software designers to create customizable point-of-sales teminals to effectively track inventory, sales trends, deliveries and state taxes. Doing so, Micah saw the infinite power of programming. Seeking new challenges, Micah decided to leave everything he built to start a new path starting at Epicodus.</p>
              <p>Micah's hobbies include gem & mineral collecting, mycology, hoticulture, hiking, motorcycles and seeking out delicious food all over the world.</p>
